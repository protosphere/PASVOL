# PASVOL
PASVOL is a small DOS TSR application to control the volume of MediaVision's Pro
Audio Spectrum (PAS) series of cards via keyboard shortcuts.

It interfaces via the MVSOUND.SYS driver and hence requires it to be installed
prior to use.

## How to use
- Ctrl-Alt-PgUp: Increase Volume
- Ctrl-Alt-PgDn: Decrease Volume

# To do
At the moment it's pretty basic and missing a lot of features I would still like
to add.

- Configurable key bindings.
- Configurable increment/decrement rate.
- Option to uninstall the TSR from memory.
- Clean up the code a bit.
